import streamlit as st

# In Streamlit, every time the user interacts with a widget (button, slider, text input, etc.),
# the entire script reruns from top to bottom. Because of this behavior,
# normal Python variables do not remember their values between interactions.

# st.session_state is a special dictionary-like object in Streamlit
# that stores data for a particular user session.

# It helps your app:
# - Remember values
# - Maintain app state
# - Store user progress
# - Preserve variables between reruns
# - Without session state, variables reset after every interaction.
